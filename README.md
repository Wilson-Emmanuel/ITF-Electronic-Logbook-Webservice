Once the application starts running, the database directory will automatically be created on the same location as the running `jar` file. The database GUI can be accessed at `localhost:9092/h2-console` with the following credentials:

* <mark>Driver class</mark> : `org.h2.Driver`
* <mark>JDBC URL</mark> : `jdbc:h2:file:./data/itflogbook`
* <mark>User Name</mark> : `logbook`
* <mark>Password</mark> : `logbook`

## Documentation
This project uses `swagger` dependencies to generate beautiful html based documentations for the APIs. The documentations can be accessed at 

`http://localhost:9092/swagger-ui/index.html`

## Authentication
This project uses `bearer token` based security to authenticate most of the requests. After login, a token is returned and such token are expected in subsequent requests for authorization. Authenticated requests also expected a header called `x-client-request-key` with value of `kdnonoeno#@2lsn`. These functionalities can be changed in the `application.properties` file.
